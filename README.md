# Back-End Developer at Mercadona, S.A.

Hi hi 🖖, welcome to my simple Git landscape! I usually work with private repos, so not much to see here. But feel free to reach out via my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.nakalabs.net) if you’d like to connect!

I specialize in developing software from scratch, tailored to your needs. No WordPress here! 😉

I also troubleshoot hardware issues 💻 and help with fresh 🌬️, secure Windows 🪟 installations, ensuring privacy 🥷 as a priority! 🔝

Need help setting up your local network? 🪐 I can wire those damn cables for you! 🔌

Although I have a wide range of experience 👨‍🔧, my main expertise lies in Back-End development, with a strong emphasis on security. 🔐

In short, I tell computers what to do... sometimes! 🖥️

Contact me at [contact@nakalabs.net](mailto:contact@nakalabs.net). ;) 📧

PS: I don’t mess with piracy. Don’t ask me to crack a Windows license—I won’t do it. The key to real security is staying legal. Cracking means you're the product. ;)
